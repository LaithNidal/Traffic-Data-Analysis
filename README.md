## Traffic Data Analysis | Exploratory Data Analysis with Python - Part 2

This project explores real-world traffic data using Python to uncover insights into traffic flow patterns, vehicle trends, and temporal variations. It demonstrates foundational data analysis, feature engineering, and visualization skills essential for data-driven decision-making.

**📘 Project Overview**

The analysis investigates how traffic conditions vary across time, day, and vehicle types to better understand urban mobility dynamics.
Key objectives include:

🧾 Data Exploration – Loading and inspecting raw traffic data using Pandas.

⚙️ Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and transforming categorical variables like Traffic Situation into numerical form for analysis.

📈 Exploratory Visualization – Creating meaningful visualizations to show traffic distribution, vehicle counts, and trends over time.

📊 Insight Generation – Identifying traffic congestion periods, vehicle-type trends, and weekday vs. weekend behavior.


**❓ Questions to Be Answered**

This analysis seeks to answer the following questions:
1. How does traffic situation vary by the day of the week?
2. What are the correlations between different vehicle types?
3. How does distribution of traffic situations differ by hour?
4. What is the total distribution of total vehicle counts for each day of the week?
5. How does variance in vehicle counts compare across vehicle types?
6. How does the average vehicle count for each vehicle type change over time?
